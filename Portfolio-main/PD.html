      <h2>Twelve Pillars Review</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Twelve Pillars</em> by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener presents 12 life-changing principles for success, personal growth, and discipline. 
        Chapters 4–7 emphasize goal setting, relationships, discipline, and self-growth as key factors for achievement.
      </p>

      <h3>The Power of Goals</h3>
      <p>
        Success is not accidental — it’s built on clear, written goals. Without direction, people drift aimlessly.
        Chapter 4 suggests setting specific, measurable, and time-bound goals to track progress and build momentum.
      </p>
      <p>This chapter was very inspirational because I’m someone who normally does not set goals.</p>

      <h3>The Influence of Relationships</h3>
      <p>
        “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.” Chapter 5 highlights the importance of surrounding yourself with positive, motivated individuals.
        The right environment inspires growth and success, while the wrong one can easily pull you down.
      </p>
      <p>
        This hit home for me because I’ve noticed that when I spend time with productive, disciplined people, I naturally become more motivated and focused.
      </p>

      <h3>Personal Development</h3>
      <p>
        Chapter 6 teaches that success and happiness don’t just happen — they are a result of who you become.
        If you want better opportunities and relationships, you must grow as a person first.
        This shifted my perspective: instead of waiting for opportunities, I should focus on becoming the kind of person who attracts them.
      </p>

      <h3>The Power of Self-Discipline</h3>
      <p>
        Chapter 7 teaches that discipline is the bridge between goals and success. 
        Achievements come from small, consistent efforts — not bursts of motivation. 
        Habits, when repeated daily, compound over time and lead to major success.
      </p>

      <h3>How Can I Apply What I’ve Read?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Set clear personal and academic goals.</li>
        <li>Surround myself with driven and goal-oriented people.</li>
        <li>Commit to lifelong learning and self-improvement.</li>
        <li>Build strong discipline in daily habits.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Future Career: Project Manager</h2>
      <p>
        In the future, I aspire to become a <strong>Project Manager</strong>. 
        I enjoy leading and organizing tasks, coordinating team efforts, and ensuring that each project meets its goals on time and within scope.
        This role aligns with my interests in technology, leadership, and planning.
      </p>

      <h3>Why Project Management?</h3>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about teamwork and problem-solving. Project management allows me to combine both — guiding people, managing challenges, 
        and delivering meaningful results that make a real impact.
      </p>
