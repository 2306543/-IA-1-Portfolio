            <h2>My Personality and Academic Life</h2>
            <p>One of my strongest traits is <span class="highlight">Prospecting</span>, which means I am naturally flexible, curious, and adaptable. 
            I enjoy exploring different learning methods instead of following strict routines. 
            This allows me to stay open to new ideas and adjust easily to academic challenges.</p>

            <p>My personality is a mix of both shy and bold, depending on the environment or the people around me. 
            While I may be quiet at first, I become confident and expressive once I feel comfortable.</p>

            <h3>How My Interests Shape My Learning</h3>
            <p>I enjoy watching movies, series, and anime, and I also love reading books—though not romance ones. 
            These interests fuel my imagination and creativity, shaping how I view the world and express myself.</p>

            <p>I don’t really have a specific role model, but I often find inspiration in the traits of characters or people I admire—like strength, loyalty, and perseverance. 
            My favorite animal is the <strong>wolf</strong>, as I see them as symbols of independence, intelligence, and deep connection with their pack—qualities I strive to embody in my own life.</p>

            <p>However, my tendency to keep options open also means I sometimes work best under pressure. 
            I often approach tasks with spontaneity, which helps me come up with creative solutions even at the last minute.</p>

            <h2>My Inspiration</h2>
            <blockquote>
                "Don't lose yourself" – Roronoa Zoro
            </blockquote>
            <p>What inspires me most is the idea of progress. I believe that growth doesn’t happen overnight, 
            but through small steps and persistence. I’m inspired by my own journey — by how far I’ve come, 
            the lessons I’ve learned, and the strength I’ve built along the way.</p>
